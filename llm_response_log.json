The user's wallet configuration allows sharing of temperature data with roadside units without requiring consent (`requires_consent: False`). This aligns with the IoV-SSI principles of decentralized identity verification, user consent (implicitly granted), privacy protection (minimal disclosure), and selective disclosure (only temperature is requested).
